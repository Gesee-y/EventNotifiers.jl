# Notifyers.jl

## Quick start

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Notifyers")
using Notifyers
```

## Intro

Event-driven system have always been a must in many domain: GUI application, robotics, plotting, etc.
There are package already addressing that subject like  [Reactive.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Reactive.jl) that use asynchronous signals or  [Observables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Observables.jl) that use synchronous Observable.

In this ecosystem, Notifyers.jl can be seen as a package that provides the better of both worlds, providing Notifyer, objects relying on states to define their behavior. We may have a synchronous state, asynchronous state, etc. And some states can be mixed together to make unique behaviors.

## Installation 

```julia
julia> ] add Notifyers
```

## Features 

   * Intuitive syntax to create Notifyer, inspired from [Godot game engine signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_signal.html) (`@Notifyer name(arg1::type1,...,argn::typen)`)
   * Multiple states to create multiple behaviors (delayed calls, async delayed calls, single task, etc)
   * States can be passed to one Notifyer to another

## Why Notifyers.jl ?

While offering comparable performance to two package above, `Notifyer` offer a versatile solution if you need both synchronous and asynchronous [observer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/observer-pattern-set-1-introduction/) in your project.

## Why states ?

I was thinking after using Reactive and Observable, on a way to get the better of both package since they did approximately the same thing but in different manner.
While learning graphic programming with OpenGL, I got inspired by, [OpenGL]'s state machine in which the procedure is simple:

   * You set a state.
   * You do some operation in this state.
   * You quit the state.

I then decide to do the same with Notifyers.
